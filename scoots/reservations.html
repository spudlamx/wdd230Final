            Insurance The Renter hereby warrants to Owner that Renter possess
            car insurance that covers personal injury to Renter or other persons
            as well as the Vehicle and the property of others. Indemnity
            Regardless of insurance coverage, Renter shall fully indemnify the
            Owner for any loss, damage, and legal actions, including reasonable
            attorneys fees that Owner suffers due to Renter’s use of Vehicle
            during the term of this Agreement, including but not limited to,
            damage to the Vehicle, damage to the property of others, injury to
            Renter, and injury to others. This provision survives the
            termination of this Agreement. Owner Warranty The Owner represents
            that to the best of his knowledge and belief that the Vehicle is in
            sound and safe condition and free of any known faults or defects
            that would affect its safe operation under normal use. Renter
            Warranties The Renter agrees that Renter will not (a) use the
            Vehicle to carry any passengers other than Renter; (b) allow any
            other person to operate the Vehicle; (c) operate the Vehicle in
            violation of any laws or for an illegal purpose and that if Renter
            does, Renter is responsible for all associated, tickets, fines, and
            fees; (d) use the Vehicle to push or tow another vehicle; (e) use
            the Vehicle for any race or competition; (f) operate the vehicle in
            a negligent manner. Arbitration In the event that the Parties cannot
            amicably resolve a dispute or damage claim resulting from this
            Agreement, the Parties agree to resolve any such dispute or damage
            claim by arbitration. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted
            in [City], [State], in accordance with the rules of the American
            Arbitration Association then in effect with one (1) arbitrator to be
            selected by mutual agreement of the Parties. If the Parties cannot
            agree on an arbitrator, then the American Arbitration Association
            shall select an arbitrator from the National Panel of Arbitrators.
            The laws of the State of [State] in the United States shall apply to
            the arbitration proceedings. The Parties agree that the arbitrator
            cannot award punitive damages to either Party and agree to be bound
            by the arbitrator’s findings. Judgment upon the award rendered by
            the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Page
            2 of 3 Sample Car Rental Contract Disputes and Governing Law. The
            laws of the State of [State] in the United States without regard to
            any conflict of law principles govern this Agreement. No action,
            arising out of the transactions under this Agreement may be brought
            by either Party more than one year after the cause of action has
            accrued. General This Agreement, including all Exhibit(s),
            constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties in connection
            with the subject matter hereof and supersedes all agreements,
            proposals, representations and other understandings, oral or
            written, of the Parties and any current or subsequent purchase
            order(s) provided by Affiliate. No alteration or modification of
            this Agreement or any Exhibits shall be valid unless made in writing
            and signed by an authorized Affiliate of each Party. The waiver by
            either Party of a breach of any provision of the Agreement shall not
            operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach and any
            waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized Affiliate of
            the Parties hereto. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
            invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in
            full force and effect. Any notice or other communication required or
            permitted hereunder shall be given in writing to the other Party at
            the address stated above, or at such other address as shall be given
            by either Party to the other in writing. Any terms of this Agreement
            which by their nature extend beyond its termination remain in effect
            until fulfilled, and apply to respective successors and rightful
            assignees.
